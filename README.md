# rock-paper-scissors-game

Hello everyone! I am super excited to be working on my third project for the Odin Project today, and better yet, my very first including Javascript! After this project, which at the time I'm writing this is just going to be a basic game played from the console in the developer tools, I should have been able to demonstrate a basic proficiency in the following: use of variables, numbers, strings, conditionals, functions, and much more in Javascript; problem-solving skills (chunking steps, planning out, etc) and use of pseudocode. But with that said, I thank you all for coming to view this repo and hope you enjoy the project!
